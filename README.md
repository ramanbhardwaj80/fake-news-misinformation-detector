# fake-news-misinformation-detector
NLP-based system to detect fake news and misinformation using TF-IDF and machine learning, built as a hackathon prototype with focus on social media and Indian context.
# Fake News & Misinformation Detector

## Problem
Fake news spreads rapidly on social media and messaging platforms, causing panic, misinformation, and social harm. In India, this issue is amplified due to linguistic diversity and high digital penetration, making manual fact-checking difficult at scale.

## Solution
This project proposes an NLP-based fake news detection system that classifies news articles or headlines as **Real** or **Fake** based on textual patterns. The system uses supervised machine learning techniques and is designed as a hackathon prototype.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLP (TF-IDF)
- Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- Kaggle Fake News Dataset
- LIAR Dataset (reference)

## Approach
1. Text preprocessing (cleaning, lowercasing, stopword removal)
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
3. Model training with Logistic Regression
4. Prediction with confidence scores
5. Flagging content for human verification

## Project Status
🚧 Hackathon Prototype – Under Development

## Future Scope
- Multilingual support (Hindi and other Indian languages)
- Transformer-based models (BERT / DistilBERT)
- Integration with fact-checking platforms (AltNews, BoomLive)
- Browser extension or messaging app integration

## Team
- BRAINSTORMERS
